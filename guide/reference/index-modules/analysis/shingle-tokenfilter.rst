A token filter of type ``shingle`` that constructs shingles (token
n-grams) from a token stream. In other words, it creates combinations of
tokens as a single token. For example, the sentence “please divide this
sentence into shingles” might be tokenized into shingles “please
divide”, “divide this”, “this sentence”, “sentence into”, and “into
shingles”.

This filter handles position increments > 1 by inserting filler tokens
(tokens with termtext “\_”). It does not handle a position increment of
0.

The following are settings that can be set for a ``shingle`` token
filter type:

Setting
Description
``max_shingle_size``
Defaults to ``2``.
``output_unigrams``
Defaults to ``true``.
