The JMX module exposes node information through
`JMX <http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/core/mntr-mgmt/javamanagement/>`_.
JMX can be used by either
`jconsole <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JConsole>`_ or
`VisualVM <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VisualVM>`_.

Exposed JMX data include both node level information, as well as
instantiated index and shard on specific node. This is a work in
progress with each version exposing more information.

jmx.domain
==========

The domain under which the JMX will register under can be set using
``jmx.domain`` setting. It defaults to ``{elasticsearch}``.

jmx.create\_connector
=====================

An RMI connector can be started to accept JMX requests. This can be
enabled by setting ``jmx.create_connector`` to ``true``. An RMI
connector does come with its own overhead, make sure you really need it.

When an RMI connector is created, the ``jmx.port`` setting provides a
port range setting for the ports the rmi connector can open on. By
default, it is set to ``9400-9500``.
