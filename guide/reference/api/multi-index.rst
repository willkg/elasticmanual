Many of elasticearch APIs support operating across several indices. The
format usually includes an index name, or a comma separated index names.
It also supports using aliases, or a comma delimited list of aliases and
indexes for the APIs.

Using the APIs against all indices is simple by usually either using the
``_all`` index, or simply omitting the index.

For multi index APIs (like search), there is also support for using
wildcards (since ``0.19.8``) in order to resolve indices and aliases.
For example, if we have an indices ``test1``, ``test2`` and ``test3``,
we can simply specify ``test*`` and automatically operate on all of
them. The syntax also support the ability to add (``+``) and remove
(``-``), for example: ``+test*,-test3``.
