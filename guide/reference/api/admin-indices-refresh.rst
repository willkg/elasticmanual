The refresh API allows to explicitly refresh one or more index, making
all operations performed since the last refresh available for search.
The (near) real-time capabilities depends on the index engine used. For
example, the robin one requires refresh to be called, but by default a
refresh is scheduled periodically.

::

    $ curl -XPOST 'http://localhost:9200/twitter/_refresh’

Multi Index
-----------

The refresh API can be applied to more than one index with a single
call, or even on ``_all`` the indices.

::

    $ curl -XPOST 'http://localhost:9200/kimchy,elasticsearch/_refresh’

        $ curl -XPOST 'http://localhost:9200/_refresh’
