The ``multi_field`` type allows to map several
`core\_types <core-types.html>`_ of the same value. This can come very
handy, for example, when wanting to map a ``string`` type, once when its
``analyzed`` and once when its ``not_analyzed``. For example:

::

    {
        “tweet” : {
            “properties” : {
                “name” : {
                    “type” : “multi_field”,
                    “fields” : {
                        “name” : {“type” : “string”, “index” : “analyzed”},
                        “untouched” : {“type” : “string”, “index” : “not_analyzed”}
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

The above example shows how the ``name`` field, which is of simple
``string`` type, gets mapped twice, once with it being ``analyzed``
under ``name``, and once with it being ``not_analyzed`` under
``untouched``.

Accessing Fields
================

With ``multi_field`` mapping, the field that has the same name as the
property is treated as if it was mapped without a multi field. Thats the
“default” field. It can be accessed regularly, for example using
``name`` or using typed navigation ``tweet.name``.

Other fields with different names can be easily accessed using the
navigation notation, for example, using: ``name.untouched``, or using
the typed navigation notation ``tweet.name.untouched``.

Merging
=======

When updating mapping definition using the ``put_mapping`` API, a core
type mapping can be “upgraded” to a ``multi_field`` mapping. This means
that if the old mapping has a plain core type mapping, the updated
mapping for the same property can be a ``multi_field`` type, with the
default field being the one being replaced.
