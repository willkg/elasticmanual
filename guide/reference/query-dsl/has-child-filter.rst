The ``has_child`` filter accepts a query and the child type to run
against, and results in parent documents that have child docs matching
the query. Here is an example:

::

    {
        “has_child” : {
            “type” : “blog_tag”
            “query” : {
                “term” : {
                    “tag” : “something”
                }
            }
        }
    }    

The ``type`` is the child type to query against. The parent type to
return is automatically detected based on the mappings.

The way that the filter is implemented is by first running the child
query, doing the matching up to the parent doc for each document
matched.

Scope
=====

A ``_scope`` can be defined on the filter allowing to run facets on the
same scope name that will work against the child documents. For example:

::

    {
        “has_child” : {
            “_scope” : “my_scope”,
            “type” : “blog_tag”
            “query” : {
                “term” : {
                    “tag” : “something”
                }
            }
        }
    }    

Memory Considerations
=====================

With the current implementation, all ``_id`` values are loaded to memory
(heap) in order to support fast lookups, so make sure there is enough
mem for it.
