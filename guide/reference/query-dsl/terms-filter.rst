Filters documents that have fields that match any of the provided terms
(**not analyzed**). For example:

::

    {
        “constant_score” : {
            “filter” : {
                “terms” : { “user” : [“kimchy”, “elasticsearch”]}
            }
        }
    }

The ``terms`` filter is also aliased with ``in`` as the filter name for
simpler usage.

Optimization
------------

Note, if the terms tend to repeat in other ``term`` or ``terms`` filter,
it is considered better to have a an ``or`` filter wrapping single
``term`` filters.

Caching
=======

The result of the filter is automatically cached by default. The
\`\_cache\` can be set to \`false\` to turn it off.
